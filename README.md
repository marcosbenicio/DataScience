# Machine Learning 

Each Jupyter notebook within this repository attempts to explore a specific machine-learning algorithm. I try to balance practical implementations with the underlying mathematical foundations of these models. Each notebook is structured around application scenarios using real-world datasets, as guided by the book  [Machine Learning Bookcamp](https://mlbookcamp.com/), while the mathematical insights are drawn from the book [Data Mining and Machine Learning](https://dataminingbook.info/)

While this repository reflects my personal journey of learning and understanding machine learning, I hope it can also be a valuable resource for others on a similar path.

## [Chapter 1: Machine Learning for Regression](https://github.com/marcosbenicio/ML_BookCamp/tree/main/01Regression)
How to create a car-price prediction project with a **linear regression** model.

## [Chapter 2: Machine Learning for Classification](https://github.com/marcosbenicio/ML_BookCamp/tree/main/02Classification)
Predicting customers who will churn with **logistic regression** for classification.

## [Chapter 3: Evaluation Metrics for Classification](https://github.com/marcosbenicio/ML_BookCamp/tree/main/03Metrics)
Study of **confusion matrix**, deriving metrics from confusion matrices, like precision and recall, and Using **ROC and AUC metrics** to further understand the performance of a binary classification. We also focus on Tuning the parameters for the model and how to use cross-validation to verify the model's behavior.

## [Chapter 4: Deploying Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/marcosbenicio/ML_BookCamp/tree/main/04Deploy)
Introduction on how to save models with Pickle and Flask, how to manage dependencies with Pipenv, and how to use Docker.

## [Chapter 5: Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning](https://github.com/marcosbenicio/ML_BookCamp/tree/main/05DecisionTrees)
Project for predicting the risk of default with tree-based models (**Decision tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost**).

# Statistics Review

## [Chapter 6: Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/marcosbenicio/ML_BookCamp/tree/main/05DecisionTrees)
understanding essential statistical metrics, exploration of relationships between features, and implementation of visualization techniques for insightful data interpretation.

## [Chapter 7: Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/marcosbenicio/ML_BookCamp/tree/main/07Sampling)
